# PersonalAssistant

This is the repository for a personal assistant I developped using keras for my "Travail de Maturit√©" for the Swiss Matura high school diploma.

By following the files in the root directory in order, you can create a personalized voice dataset, train a speech recognizer, define your own commands, train a word to phoneme model and use concatentative speech synthesis for output.

While it is currently not perfect, this is my first attempt at this project and I will continue to improve upon it.
