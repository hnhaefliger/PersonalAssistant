Much of the sand is fine quartzitic sand typical of the Cape Peninsula beaches, but there are also scattered areas of gravel and shell

Keep a lookout up and down so you dont miss any
This is a hollow in the reef is almost surrounded by high rocks
The mouth is always visible, and the cave tapers slowly with a sudden end
Further along the shoreline is a deep gully that extends several metres into the cliffside

This means that you can use the surge to lift you, but must then get out of the way before the next wave
It is recommended that a crew member is left on board

All are slippery and steep, with loose gravel
These must be avoided and passed round to the north
This means that you just have to look closely at the critters, and for this a light is useful
The site can only be accessed by boat
You will pass along the east wall, then turn to the west into a gully with high reef on both sides
It is not known at this stage whether it is big enough to swim through
